UAV Assembly
====================

Lets build a drone!

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

Overview of Process & Materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO: Expand on how to make the drone. If one has access to a 3d printer you can 3d print components or out source to com
oanies like Xometry or SendCutSend. All files are available


The follow page assumes you have all of the required materials. If you haven't bought & manufactured all of the base
go back to TODO: Link page with BOM and instructions for 3d printing and manufacturing

Carbon Fiber Arms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Required Materials**

* 4 - 120mm Carbon Rods TODO: Double check length
* 4 - Motor Mounts
* 4 - Arm Mounts
* 4 - Arm Molds
* 24 - M3 Heat-set inserts
* JB Weld Plastic Bonder
* Painters Tape


**Gluing Arms Together**

Before gluing, clear your work table. Use either a silicon mat or lay paper towels across your work table as you don't want
to get JB weld ever where. You also want a pair of gloves, a cup to mix the JB weld in and a stiring stick. 

After that grab your carbon rods, arm mounts, motor mounts and molds. Below is a picture of all those components.

First wrap each of your carbon rods with painters tape in the middle leaving a section that can be used to pull the arm out
of the mold once cured. Below shows rods taped:

Next you'll glue the arms together. Note: the JB weld only has 10 minutes of good working time so if your doing this by yourself
only do two arms at a time to give yourself plenty of time. Now open the JB weld, push out about and 2 quarter size blobs into your container. 
Stir the two parts of the JB thoroughly; after mixing use your stir stick to coat the inside of the motor mount with JB. Then coat the inside 
& outside of the carbon rod. After both the mount and rod had a thin coating slowing insert the rod while spinning it. Make sure there is always 
a thin ring of JB weld around the rod. If there isn't you need more JB. Use a paper towel to remove any excess JB. Repeat the process for the arm
mount. Note: the Motor mount takes more glue then the arm mount. After both sides have been glued rotate the pieces so the tape aligns with the 
top of the motor & arm mount. Slowly insert the glued assembly into the mold. Push firmly to ensure the mounts lay flat within the mold. Repeat the process
for the other 3 arms. Final notes

.. note::

  Don't use too much glue without wiping it away before putting it in the mold or the arm will glue itself to the mold

After waiting 24 hours for a full cure before removing the arms from the molds. To remove the arms use the tape to pull the arms out or
insert two rods into the holes in the bottom of the mold while pressing against the mold to pop the arm out of the mold.

**Heat Set Inserts**

Before getting started, go over the following resources on how to use thermoplastic heat set inserts.

As shown in the video a jig for the iron helps create a better product. You can follow the instructions 
to make one from `adafruit <https://learn.adafruit.com/heat-set-rig?view=all>`_
